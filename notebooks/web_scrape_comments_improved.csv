"I was in the data analytics part time bootcamp on 2020. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Since the beginning, the material was really clear and complete. Teachers support me since day 1 and guide me through out the course. Knowing my classmates... Read More and doing projects with them was an excellent way to code better and to have different perspectives. It was challenging but at the same time, very satisfying to see my advance and my understanding of the languages and the coding skills. For sure I would recommend it.Read Less"
"I really have to take some time to speak about the off-classes school structure, it was one of the best I have ever experienced. The organization is really supportive on the students necessities and thinks outside the box regarding learning procedures,... Read More for that we have to congratulate Ironhack. As for the classes, they are also well structured, with a well defined purpose which are practical exercises, being very clear how in a real world situation a data analyst should approach the situation. Thank you for your patience Ignacio and thank you for your constant clear feedback and suggestions, Maria. As for an improvement advice, I think Ironhack should dedicate more teaching time to MySQL, statistics and Tableau. Nevertheless if a student is pro-active the learning curve can continue to improve because the base tools are in fact mentioned during the classes.Read Less"
It was an amazing experience to learn from great teachers who have a lot of world culture and knowledge in the data analytics area. It was even more rewarding to be able to daily put knowledge into practice while working with incredible classmates and...

"Recently I became a proud Ironhack Alumni! I did the UX/UI Design Bootcamp in Paris (remote). I come from a business background where I learned many of the tools we used during the Bootcamp but applied in different contexts. I want to share with you some... Read More of the main insights after having lived this experience. PROS • The Ironhack crew is incredible, everyone is kind and understanding, and always open to help. • They emphasize the importance of mental health during the Bootcamp, I really appreciated that. • You have a lot of documentation for all of the different topics touched during the Bootcamp. • Careerhack guidelines and tools are on top. CONS • The pace is fast! Keep in mind that it will feel like jumping from one thing to the next, but at some point everything will connect, trust me. • The format is not adapted to different types of learning. The motto is ""learn by doing"", which is great! But if you are a person who learns differently, it might be a little hard for you to grasp the info, since it can be a lot to take in. • If it is your first time interacting with subjects like Design Thinking, Lean, etc... It can be a little overwhelming. • If you have never used any design software (like Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.), you may take a little longer to understand with Figma. I suggest practicing and discovering the software on your own before the Bootcamp. SUGGESTIONS • Organize your days. Do you consider yourself an unorganized person? Find a method that works for you, otherwise, you'll find yourself overwhelmed with many To-Dos. • Take time for yourself. Find time to do those things that recharge your energy because, as I just mentioned in the previous point, you can easily find yourself feeling overwhelmed. • If you have time before the Bootcamp, use it! Go through all the Careerhack tasks, this will make your life easier later. Also, I would definitely contact Alumni to learn about CVs, LinkedIn, Portfolios, or even ask about topics and tools that you don't know or would like to know better. If you do all these things in advance, you'll save a lot of time and feel less overwhelmed. You will learn many things (I hope) and have the opportunity to connect with amazing people with completely different backgrounds and personalities. Find and use methods that work for you, ask for help if needed, keep in mind that communication and empathy will be very important, and enjoy the ride because even though it feels like it will never end, it will. So to conclude, personally this Bootcamp meant a lot to me, academically, professionally, and personally. It helped me get back on track, I learned a lot even though I already knew the tools we were using, and I met incredible people! I totally recommend the UX/UI Design Bootcamp at Ironahck.Read Less"
"When I started I was a little disappointed but then I was surprised, it’s actually great and very intense, if you’re not into that, it’s not for you, maybe take the half time bootcamp not full time, I would advise it to people who are interested but please... Read More be prepared and read a little before, as for students already from a design background might be a little weird for you as it is made more for all types of backgrounds, but it’s great overall, as for the one I did, heads up they spoke French sometimes because well duh it’s Paris, I do understand French though, took me two weeks to fully adapt but I do understand so if that’s a problem for you I don’t know maybe check little more before registration depends on the teacher, the teacher did his best but sometimes some words slipped and not all the students are as fluent so yea. But the bootcamp overall was a good experience, I experienced it in hybrid mode online and I can attend physically, it wasn’t that bad, sometimes annoying for working in groups but it was a super interesting experience, as for the bootcamp gained knowledge, I feel there is room for improvement but doesn’t mean it’s bad, it’s actually very good but still can be improved further and it will be top of the top to be honest, the staff are super super friendly, man I can’t emphasise how good and amazing they were, as a new expat that was very important to me and so were the students, my design squad hopefully we will stay friends for life, the campus man, I want to live there, top tbh top, that’s all pros I guess, I’ll add up some cons shortly but overall I loved the experience and gained knowledge, anyone with previous knowledge, throw that aside and learn from the start then connect, you’ll never learn enough with a half filled cup, empty the cup, learn then mix it up and flood yourself with knowledge. As for me tbh, I come from a design background so the first two weeks was very hard to work with others who knew nothing so be patient we are all there to learn. Another thing is the hybrid mode, I personally loved it, if it’s any problem to you, you can attend there and do online together but if you’re not a fan then wait until it goes back to normal hopefully soon crossed fingers. As for the bootcamp all in all, I would advise people who want such thing and have some problems committing to study on their own specially, this will be good for you, plus you’ll be certified. My only problem tbh, might not be my only one, it is while I’m writing this because just top of my mind, I know it’s long sorry hehe, the money, kind of expensive tbh specially that I got a couple of promotions and I wasn’t allowed to apply them together, some people paid more, some paid less, some didn’t pay at all they got full scholarships, which felt weird to be honest, but alas we were there to learn so doesn’t matter but it would have felt way better if it was a little cheaper than it is now, at least that’s my judgment, I come from another country where salaries are way less and the economy barely equates so might be only me but my opinion haa. Anyway to conclude, have a lovely week and put effort to be set up for success. xoRead Less"
"I graduated from Ironhack Miami's full-time web development bootcamp this March and I can't recommend it enough. I was very hesitant at first to join any sort of bootcamp. I looked into it a few years ago and compared them all. I weighed pros and cons... Read More and in the end always thought I could make it without the help of a bootcamp so I just waited and pretended that I would start the job search eventually but two years later I was still unemployed. I got an email from OfferUp announcing their partnership with Ironhack and it piqued my interest. I gave it a shot and won a partial scholarship which was enough to offset the interest fees from the loan. I was also able to get approved for the loan by one of their financing partners despite having a very poor credit score and high credit utilization which was a blessing! As the title of my review says, I had already been programming since I was a teenager. I've worked on several multiplayer game mods and even created games, programs and websites of my own. Being self-taught is great! There was one big drawback however; I could not find a job. My resume was awful, I did not know how to network nor the true importance of networking. I had no clue how to sell myself or how to talk to recruiters. It was obvious to me that joining a bootcamp would not make me gain any significant technical skills considering my extensive background. I already had a fair understanding of the material being taught and could have brushed up those skills within a week or two. So why did I join Ironhack? Simply for the one and only Daniel Brito from Ironhack's Career services. Throughout the bootcamp, I was able to schedule one-on-one meetings with him in order to discuss my career goals as well as get advice on how to approach certain companies and very good interview preparation help. I always had so many questions prepared for him yet I only needed to ask him one question and he would predict my next 2-3 questions and answer them in advance. He really knows his stuff! As soon as Brito walked us through updating our LinkedIn profiles, I was assaulted by recruiters left and right and didn't know what to do. He pointed me in the right direction, told me what to watch out for and what to expect. He gave me the confidence that I needed to aim high and shoot for the positions I didn't see myself achieving for another 5 years. Thanks to his guidance, I landed a job two weeks before graduating as a DevOps engineer for an amazing company who works with what is in my opinion the best tech stack you can have in 2021. Compared to other bootcamps that say you don't pay until you get hired (or worse, the ones that take a percentage of your salary!) Ironhack was the only clear viable choice for me. I knew full well going into it that I was there for Brito first and foremost and to make great connections second. I've created some relationships that I hope to carry with me for life not only with fellow students but with my teacher Niko as well. I can't say enough about the teacher I had. Honestly I have never seen a teacher so passionate when it comes to his student's success. Most teachers would traditionally stop and go MIA as soon as the clock turns over or your time in the bootcamp is up, but not at Ironhack. Niko and I actually started a passion project together which is aimed at helping students stay in touch and keep learning and connecting with others even post-graduation. I think that speaks for itself in the amount of care that goes into your learning experience. You'll never feel like you're just a number on a spreadsheet that needs to get a grade. If you are in the same situation I was four months ago meaning you are passionate about code, are self taught and have been struggling to enter the professional world or are simply afraid of the financial burden of having to take out a loan, take it from me. I went from earning 16k/year from self-employment income to now earning six figures doing the job I've been dreaming about ever since I was a teenager. I'll be receiving my first paycheck two days from now and I still can't believe it. All it took was one small leap of faith and trusting reviews from another course review website to completely change my life not just in this moment but for the rest of it.Read Less"
"I did the full time bootcamp. It was just before the second lockdown so I followed classes on the campus and on Zoom. I have mixed feelings about it so I made 2 lists. Let's start with the cons (so I can finish on a positive note): - There is only 1 teacher.... Read More He's called lead teacher but he is the only one so ""lead"" here is irrelevant. I think it's a shame because there are so many ways to do design that learning just one approach is a bit short. - They make you buy a macbook for nothing. There are two 3 hour lessons on Sketch. Which is pretty much the only reason you'd need a Mac. keep your money, work on a PC and borrow a MacBook for these lessons. You'll be fine. - Figma &amp; Sketch Labs are very very light. I really feel I still can't make the most of them. - The webdev week is laughable. The ""lead teacher"" was trying his best to teach us webdev basics. I was expecting a proper webdev teacher with structured and organized classes. I thought my 8000€ would buy that. I was naive. - The social aspect is cheap. They emphasize on the possibility to network and all the fabulous events that are organized... It doesn't exist. There are IronBeers on the rooftop once a week with one beer/person that they put in the fridge in advance so you can't really come unexpectedly. For the last one we had a few chips, 1 slice of ham per person and madeleines from Franprix with cheap wine. Just sad and cheap. Now let's talk about the pros: - the remote classes didn't feel so remote. They had some training with the first lockdown. It was pretty easy to follow even though we weren't on the campus. - The educational method is very efficient. You start working on projects from day one. You practice directly what you learn during class which makes it immediately very concrete and understandable. - At the end of the bootcamp, I felt ready to work. I had projects to show on my resume and I had some work worth a portfolio. And that is what counts!!!! - The career week and the coaching are both very good. I just finished so I can't tell more but from I've seen so far, it's the first time I feel supported in my job search. To wrap it up, like I said in the title: it's a good bootcamp but you can probably find the same quality for less money. So if you have a grant or subsidy of any kind go for it!Read Less"

"My story is similar to many Ironhackers. I had a decent career prior to taking a long sabbatical to travel. I taught myself the basics of coding but breaking into the development world, as a self-taught Jr Developer, can be difficult. My time at Ironhack... Read More taught me how to polish my portfolio, create a winning LinkedIn profile and how to approach finding a job in the “real world.” It worked great! I was busy getting my development environment set up for my new job as we were trying to finish our final projects. Needless to say it was rewarding. Tiring, but rewarding. My teacher was new to teaching so I will give him a lot of slack for understanding, teaching style, preparation and professionalism. Being able to self-teach and research documentation are both important skills so learning that is critical anyhow. I’m all about self improvement and learning new skills but when it comes down to it, it’s about getting work. Ironhack delivered. As a note: The hiring network tends to be local to the school so choose a location in a market that you want to work in. The career fair that Brito put together was unbelievable. There was a feeding-frenzy of local companies (20+) looking to hire in a well orchestrated event. The companies ranged the gamut from Citrix and Royal Caribbean to small startups. Ironhack campuses are all over the world so there is bound to be a place for you to enjoy, while you get your foot in the door of the dev world. Once you get your first dvelopment job it is much easier to find another position that is in another market. Bottom line, if you do your best, know how to learn and stay focused you will both enjoy your time and end up getting work. I want to thank the whole Ironhack team and also want to thank Brito personally. He was a pleasure to work with and a HUGE help!!!Read Less"
"Ironhack is something that changes you forever. I know it's hard to believe it but I'll do my best to explain my point of view.I joined the full-time web development bootcamp to make a career change and it was a complete success: I went from being an... Read More engineer in another country to being a web developer in France in a matter of months!I already had some knowledge about the taught topics prior to the bootcamp - that helped a lot as the course is really intense - but I still needed to consolidate my skills, acquire new ones and focus full-time on coding.Not only did the bootcamp match those expectations, it also allowed me to land my dream job in little more than a month since graduation and it was a great investment for my future.The course structure is great and each module focuses on a key aspect: it helps keeping things that simple. Also the technical stack is modern and highly valuable in the job market; you learn JavaScript and then use it in the backend and in the frontend; I think it's a smart choice and you can have so much more practice using always the same language.If I had to highlight just one aspect of the bootcamp, it would be working on the 3 projects with other students: it really helped shaping us as developers and working with people with so diverse backgrounds - but with the same objective in life - was the greatest learning and working experience I've ever had.Thanks to the topics covered during classes, which were always engaging and featuring what you really need to know, we were able to progress really quickly. The instructors and teaching assistants were extremely helpful and they always strove to make everything as smooth as possible for all the students.Pair programming and exercises were a daily task and they allowed us to discover many topics and real life workflows in software development.However a lot of effort is required to stay on track: only passion and commitment will drive you through the 9 weeks, so be sure about your objectives and dreams. If it checks for you, then you'll be a perfect match.Also the career services were a great asset to me: I have learnt all you need in order to find the right job. We met several professionals in the sector during the whole course and the hiring fair was a blast! We met 14 companies (and some of us were hired by these very companies) in 2 days and it was the best training I could have asked for all the following interviews.However I think that the course materials (written lessons and exercises) still need some improvement: as technologies evolve so quickly, it's hard to keep all the materials up to date. I don't think that this issue was a limiting factor for the bootcamp at all but I'd like to be honest about it. Also a major revision of the contents is in progress, so I wouldn't worry too much about it. Moreover Ironhack keeps growing and evolving so it can only get better with time.On a final note, the location and the people you meet there are amazing and you'll definitely want to stick around every day.I hope this review can be useful to other people as I've tried to cover some of the topics that concerned me before joining the course. Finding out that such a short formation can bring so much value was the greatest surprise to me and I can't recommend it enough to people who are committed to changing their life.Read Less"

"Attending Ironhack's full time UX/UI Design program was something that I was interested in but not sure if I should take on. Someone recommended it to me, and after seeing his success and all around improvement in life, I knew it was a chance I could... Read More not pass up. I'm so glad I did the program! Not only did I learn countless valuable skills that will help me as a designer, I gained an entire family, network, and support system. My instructor David served as a mentor and friend when he wasn't teaching, and the events and guest speakers hosted by Ironhack never disappointed. I feel ready to take on the world of design, and I've already started applying design thinking to all aspects of my life. I definitely recommend Ironhack if you are seeking to change your career, improve your skillset and make yourself more valuable, learn something new, or just gain a community that you know you can rely on!Read Less"
"I took the full-time web-development course with Ironhack Paris in Spring 2018. We learned MEAN stack. I am completely satisfied with the course material. It was quite challenging, but I received the support I needed to advance throughout the 10 weeks.... Read More The instructors and staff exceeded expectations. The main instructor, Nizar, teaches in a clear and enthusiastic manner and truly cares about his students' learning. I've been a lifetime student and would not hesitate to say he is one of the best professors I've ever had. I am also pleased with the career services from Ironhack. They helped us with our CVs, our personal brand, and our pitches. All these have helped tremendously during my interviews. Ironhack also sets up a hiring day, where they match students and potential employers for on-site interviews. It was good practice and one company followed-up with me and gave me an offer for a full-stack job (only 6 days after the end of the bootcamp!). Potential, but small issues: 1) I've heard from other students that many companies in Paris are looking for developers who know React.js or Vue.js. We learned Angular. However, I personally haven't had any problems with this, and most companies I have met with so far recognize my ability to learn difficult subjects quickly. Even more, most companies have seemed impressed by the quality of our final project. 2) The course is taught in English, but a decent level of French helps when interacting with TAs, connecting with other students in the class, and finding a job afterward. Overall, I highly recommend!Read Less"
"As someone who had no experience at all programming, this bootcamp was a great first step and saved me several months of studying on my own. For those who are considering Ironhack and also have no experience at all, I would strongly recommend them though... Read More to take a cpuple of months in advance to properly get familiarized with Javascript and have time enough to prepare the precourse content.About the course, I feel lucky for having had such a great teacher, André, who is so involved and genuinely commited in making all of us learn and achieve our goals during the course. There are also 3 TA's who are super supportive and help you in your daily challenges. And Ironhack's staff is also super nice and willing to help you in whatever you need, especially in the job search.I must say I also did a research before joining Ironhack and it is the best when comparing the ratio quality/cost/timeRead Less"
"Ironhack has been one of the best experiences on my life. I love their fast-paced learning model. It truly changes the complete paradigm on what education is built upon. As a designer, you get the tools to learn and advance your career into a new spectrum.... Read More The staff is extremely friendly. At the end of the day, you spend 8 hours + on campus. And, their job is to make you feel at home as possible. Another great thing that the staff should be rewarded is their leniency. They will be as open and helpful with your academic path as possible. The teachers were great, I personally did like the rotation of teacher's because it provided a fresh outlook every week. This I really appreciated it. Sometimes it collided with my old school way of thinking but, I saw the repercussion of this training model after. Overall I would say that Ironhack deserves a 9/10. If you want to make a difference in your life go ahead an take on this challenge.Read Less"
"This is a personal opinion about my experience at IronHack Barcelona. I have to introduced myself as a customer experience and product oriented person, which means that I’m very sincere with all my experiences and also try to apply all that I’ve learned... Read More as an entrepreneur with a small non-tech startup company which focus on customer experience and product development. When I like something, I’ll be the best ambassador of that product or service, but when I’m not happy, I’m always very honest about my reviews. This is part of my own personal opinion of my whole bootcamp experience. Something that I wish someone would have told me before joining the bootcamp.Before deciding to attend to IronHack, I have had several interviews for a few coding schools in the United States that were 12-weeks courses. Unfortunately, I didn’t get enough funds to attend to the one I really wanted. Then I found about IronHack in Barcelona that was a 8-week course and which the city’s living costs were also more affordable. Also all the reviews were almost 5 stars, so I decided to apply and prepare for the journey.I did a lot of online tutorials and practices few simple coding challenges because the previous schools that I applied to demanded to have basic programming knowledge. I was very surprised that the interview process was very easy, maybe is because the main focus of the school is to take students from 0% to 80%. I had the chance that a friend that attended another bootcamp had shared with me his experience of his pre-work of the other school. So I was kind of surprised how disorganized and how poorly made the pre-course work was. We were not even ask how we were doing with it at the time.I wrote my own very personal review, but since one of my classmates have better english writing skills and I couldn’t agree more on what the author wrote, which its content is similar the two pages I wrote, I asked for permission for posting and editing the review. I’ll just highlight a few other personal comments starting with to slashes ( // ) at the end of each paragraph of the author’s review.We were supposed to be sent a overall bootcamp feedback survey, but even before that they were already asking us for positive feedback. My classmate’s review post and my personal add-ons:“ … Still, there has yet to be any surveys sent out, yet each week we had to complete two surveys on the quality of our instructors. This speaks volumes to the quality and goals of Ironhack. Additionally, we were told that there would be extensive career help, even a spreadsheet for us to fill out in order for Ironhack to track our progress, yet, this request for a review was sent out before even a slight mention of such a spreadsheet. There’s been no career follow up, no LinkedIn or resume reviews and I am extremely disappointed, to say the least.// Before attending the bootcamp, IronHack sent me a PDF of more than 5 slides with “career support” that was supposed to taught during the whole duration of the bootcamp.I’m an entrepreneur, and one of the things that completly appreciated about this bootcamp is that it was meant for entrepreneurs, as their Twitter profile says, note that not a single lecture involved any entrepreneurial concept with code.My experience at Ironhack was amazing in regards to my peers and the quality of our TAs. Despite there being only one TA per 8 students, they went above and beyond to help us out and it was so appreciated. // Thanks to the TAs for all their effort!Aside from that, I entirely regret choosing Ironhack for my bootcamp experience as Ironhack has failed at their only two objectives: be a great educator and be a great business. My list of possible improvements is endless, but here are a few:  1 Start by actually vetting your instructors. Have them do a test run in front of you. Are they comfortable with public speaking? Do they engage the audience? Are they clear when speaking English? Are their materials written in proper English? Are the passionate about working with others? If you don’t know the answers to these questions, you shouldn’t be hiring the instructor. If you wouldn’t want to listen to them on a Monday morning, don’t hire them. Period. // There were days that I honestly think I’d learned more in CodeSchool, that the current lecture because some of the teachers didn’t seem to be prepared or didn’t have high teaching skills. 2 Be upfront about the condition of the work space and classroom. Ironhack should be ashamed of the condition of our classroom in Barcelona. I was ashamed when posting class pictures because the room looked so horrible and rundown, and it was. Paint chipping, the room hadn’t been swept or dusted in forever, there were maybe only three quality chairs in the entire room (how are developers supposed to code for over 10 hours a day on plastic chairs?), the room was unbearably hot and we had to pretty much protest for weeks in order to get fans which then just circulated all of the dust around the room. The projector didn’t even have a screen and it was close to impossible to follow along with the instructors having to adjust their settings so frequently. The tables were not actually tables, but rather pieces of lumber stacked on wooden posts even though the average Mac in the classroom was worth $1500. If one of those Macs were to fall and break, I think we can both say that Ironhack was not going to cover the costs.  // The first thing I’d learn while studying at industrial engineering: work conditions (weather, ergonomics, etc) affects productivity. I truly understand and appreciate that Barcelona is such a environmentally friendly city, but take into account that 80% of our bootcamp was not form Barcelona, and I’m from Panama City, Panama (Central America), where is 30ºC all year round, and I haven’t been that suffocated by heat in a workspace in my entire life. 6 tables, 2 fans, not enough! By day 2 there where two more, and that wasn’t even enough. I literally had to bring my personal fan until the last day of the bootcamp because I couldn’t focus on class or during my final project. Some electric extension were laying on the floor, where easily more than 10 times people have tripped because of them. Also, as programmers that were supposed to spend 10hrs+ a day in that room, I expected to at least have basics: water and coffee. Filtered water tanks or water dispensers with filters, specially when not even people from Barcelona drink their own tap water because it is awful!  3 Reevaluate which students are accepted into the program. While of course more students mean more money, if you don’t have enough TAs and are unwilling to provide more, then simply get more selective and accept fewer students. Also, students who have been working as a developer and beginners are not to be in the same class. Reevaluate your mission as a school and choose an audience. The majority of the time, it felt as if the instructors were speaking to 3 of the 16 students. // Either you take people from 0% to 80%, or from 20% to 120%. There where students that haven’t even finished the pre-work before coming to class, and were accepted to start anyway. A lot of them were so lost on the basic concepts. I think it may have downgraded the class for people with more experience.  4 Establish your worth as a school and stick to it. Although each student paid the same amount, certain students have been afforded the opportunity to retake the bootcamp. If that is the case, are the rest of the students going to get half of their money back? I didn’t think so. I, in no way, learned as much as I thought I would have and I know I would have been given more attention had I chosen one of the American bootcamps, yet a second round at Ironhack was never offered to me. Keep it fair, it’s as a simple as that. // The fact that there were several students that either dropped out or very lost in class and they just decided to skip some subjects and do what they could, should have never happened on the first place if the pre-work was better built and proper follow-up student/pre-work would have existed. 5 While MOB is clearly not the correct choice to host Ironhack, at the bare minimum, if it is known that there is going to be loudly obnoxious construction the FINAL DAY OF PRESENTATIONS, the day for which we prepare during the entire bootcamp, the day that Ironhack invites guests to listen to its student’s present, you find an alternative space in Barcelona to host the presentations. It’s not that hard, not to mention Ironhack’s connections to startups with amazing presentation spaces. I’m sure those startups would have loved the exposure and would have loved to be a part of the presentations. Get creative, don’t get lazy. // At the HackShow, there where 40-50 people in that room, and I felt ashamed that the audience had to uncomfortable watch our presentations which such heat. Also, as a finalist for the top projects, I was very sad that not a single video was taken by IronHack, like the previous cohorts, or even t-shirts with our handles where given to all the students, to have memories about our experience presenting our final project. This may not sound very important, but if you start adding features, even as almost meaningless like the previously mentioned, you shouldn’t downgrade by taking it away. *MOB: Makers Of Barcelona, where the bootcamp was being held.* 6 Know your audience. During our “hiring help days”, the first thing that Alvaro said was that most of us probably aren’t comfortable with networking and approaching strangers. False. The majority of my class came from backgrounds like communications, media, marketing, sports, recruiting, journalism, customer service, etc. Learn about your students before you attempt to advise them. Additionally, don’t have us go into a corner and show you our LinkedIn profiles while you tear them apart — it’s not thorough and it’s inefficient. Take the time to look at the profiles in advance, take some notes and then discuss with us. It will save both your time and the student’s. // I like people being realistic, but Alvaro saying that it was almost impossible to get a job in Spain as a non european, was absolutely demotivational. Nevertheless, one of my classmates and me, non europeans, got job offers, because we manage to find alternatives to pursue success. So, don’t just say it’s almost impossible without providing work arounds. Also, how come you claim to have a 97% rate of hired students when not even 50% of the students are showing up at interviews and with such non-existing follow-up after that? 7 Hire more TAs. Don’t be greedy. Money is great, but a stronger reputation is worth much more and ensures longevity. Having to sit and wait 40 minutes to ask a question is beneficial for no one, especially a newbie.// I get that some students may have slow pace while learning, but the other students that are paying the same amount of money, deserve the same kind of attention and assistance during class. If you don’t want to let anyone behind, make sure that each student is really prepared to start a coding bootcamp. 8 Lastly, hire someone that has both customer service and teaching experience to facilitate the education aspects of Ironhack. You need them. As a former educator, most of the things that went wrong were simply due to lack of planning and experience. Even our welcome meeting was lackluster and could have been full of creative and light-hearted icebreakers designed to get everyone introduced to one another. // TAs had enough work as being TAs, someone that takes care of the customer experience and product is very needed so we don’t end out writing this long reviews!!!I truly hope you view this feedback as constructive more than anything. Everyone wants to see Ironhack succeed, but without some adjustments it’s truly not worth it. “// Couldn’t agree more with this! And now, one of my best friends, who I recommended to learn to code and go to IronHack, is about to take the next cohort, and I just wish he can have a better over-all experience that I’d had. I’ll definitly take another bootcamp in the next few years, this time one made in the USA.Read Less"
"My experience at Ironhack was very positive one. As a minority and female with limited coding experience, I was doubtful at the beginning if I could complete the program. However, after 8 weeks, I not only completed the program, but also was able to develop... Read More a web application from scratch. Before Ironhack, I was in business, doing completely unrelated to programming. I even had a great fear for anything technology. One day I decided to cast off my fear of tech and started learning how to code. Though I was studying dilligently, it was very inefficient. As a responsible adult with responsibilities to fulfill, I thought going to school and learn ""how to learn coding"" in a short amount of time seemed efficient than reading posts after posts on stackoverflow. And, I am glad to tell you that I made the right decision. What makes Ironhack very unique was people - my classmates, the teachers and the staff. My classmates were from all walks of life and open-minded, which made me feel ok to ask even seemingly silly questions in the class. I still hang out with some of my classmates even after the program ended. The teachers were great, too. Though some classes and the curriculum have rooms for improvement such as installing some programs prior to the cohort begins, the lead teacher, with knowlege, passion for coding and teaching, patience and care for each one of us, made my learning experience the excelent one. The staff. I decided to attend Ironhack because of the staff. Everyone was always thinking about how to create an open and comfortable environment and make the learning experience fun. They provided us many opportunites like happy hour, beach BBQ, and pinada smashing (to release our stress) for us to socialize and have some break. They also set up a weekly meeting where students can provide feedback and share their thoughts. People there were ""real.""Lastly, Ironhack provided great job assistance. Of course, I had to do 99% of the work following their strategic advice, but they set up interviews with companies (I received a job offer from one of them), provided useful resources and followed up with me on the phone almost weekly for practical advice and encouragement. As a result, I received a few job offers and am currently working for a growing tech company (where my colleagues know the Ironhack lead instructor).Ironhack really changed my life. There are many schools out there with different emphasis but I think the value of going to a coding school is to build skills, confidence and knowledge to continuously learn new technologies. Like myself, many coding school students will probably end up learning something new or maybe unrelated to what they have learned at school. Then, my recommendation is to go to a place like Ironhack where you interact with good people in a good environment where your learning experience will be joyful.Read Less"
"A little about me, my previous career I was a Registered Nurse, but wish I had always gone into software and eventually landed on coding bootcamps as my attempt to become a software developer. I found it incredibly difficult to decide on which bootcamp... Read More to attend given the rising number of bootcamps out there and the high risk of many being non-legitimate. Eventually I found a few that seemed to be solid bootcamps and ultimately chose to go with App Academy based out of San Francisco/New York. If you are in the same position as I was, then you probably have researched many reviews as well and come to find that it really goes 50-50 on whether to do a coding bootcamp or not to do one. So many people say its worthless and a waste of money and how you can learn it all on your own or to pursue a computer science degree instead. Me personally? learning on my own was not going to work. Having the structure and discipline a bootcamp provides was exceedingly beneficial, especially in how they slowly advance you in learning topics. When learning on your own you get very lost in where to start and what frameworks to pick up, you end up in a constant limbo of learning small things here and there but never really gaining true knowledge of how things work. I recently completed the 6-month online software engineer track with App Academy in April of 2022. Before I started this program I spent about a month with on and off learning through websites such as Free Code Camp, Codecademy, and youtube videos. Essentially, I came in with next to know knowledge of coding. Most bootcamps are designed for people with very little coding knowledge, and build them up to speed as fast as possible. As most reviews say, attending a coding bootcamp can be very difficult and will take up most of your time. I can attest to this, It will definitely take up almost all of your time for the time you are enrolled, but I promise you it is not as hard as they say it is, it is very doable. For the 6-month online program, it was mon-fri 8am-5pm and had tests on every monday in which you need to pass to advance to the next week. You can only fail the tests or the projects (there were 4 projects total) combined of 3 times. But don't let that scare you, so many people have done this and have been successful, and App Academy does a really good job of preparing you with practice tests and office hours. They have various payment methods, which usually comes out to be around 20-22k depending on how you choose to pay. They are on the higher end of the spectrum of bootcamp affordability, but in my personal opinion, well worth it. With that said I had a great experience with App Academy and highly recommend them if you are searching for a well established bootcamp. One of the best features is that they have a career team that continues to do work shops and hiring events after you complete the program help you in your job search. I am not sure if other bootcamps do this, but this is a must, they help to keep you focused after you finish to keep learning and applying so that you will obtain that job. Don't be afraid if you do decide to choose App Academy and see that there are 100 people in your online cohort, within the first 3 weeks that number can drop in half with people deciding they don't like coding and people failing because they are not truly dedicated to learning. It is also true that most of the teachers/aides are previous students, do not be alarmed by this either, every single bootcamp does this. But do know that they have real experienced software engineers above them that also provide lectures and guide the curriculum to ensure that the correct things are being taught and that we are progressively learning. At the end of completing any bootcamp, don't expect to land a job within a few months, while it certainly does happen, it is definitely not the norm. You have to continuously work on projects/learn new concepts/study DSA/obtain certificates/ and most importantly do not stop applying to jobs. Completing the bootcamp is one part, the job search is a whole different monster, but I promise this bootcamp offers enormous help once you finish to land that job. Sorry if some of my thoughts are random through this, I am trying to put down every thing I found to be important and what I wish I had knew before I started lol. All in all if you decide on App Academy it is absolutely legit, you will learn enormous amounts, and it will be incredibly fun if you love coding. As stated above I finished in April of 2022, I just now landed a remote software engineer job this month of November 2022, it took me 6 months to land my first job and around 1000-1200 job applications. Sounds like a lot right? Many people including Computer Science graduates have this same issue in the job search. It takes a while to land that first job because everyone wants experienced engineers. Its a crappy situation, but once your in, your in. Right now the average to land that job is 6 months, sometimes sooner, and sometimes later. But it is very cool to say that I made it, from Registered Nurse to Software Engineer. I'm sure you want to hear the salary as well, it was always annoying to see people who got jobs but never listed their salary, it would be incredibly helpful if they did. For me, I am starting out at around 70k. If your in a big tech city such as San Francisco you will easily be over 100k but remember cost of living there is insane. For an entry level position I am pretty happy with that salary, within a couple years it could easily jump to 150+, but ultimately I just want to learn and grow more with a great work-life balance, so money is secondary to me. Final words, in case you were wondering if these reviews are fake or App Academy paid me to do this, they did not. That was another fear I had when searching, was that so many bootcamps had such great reviews lol. But this is absolutely my honest review, bootcamps are not for everyone, but if you truly do want to make the switch, be prepared with enough money to last you for a year, 6 months to do the program and 6 months to find a job. I hope this aides you in your search, and absolutely keep App Academy as one of your top choices if it is not already.Read Less"

"App Academy (aA) should really be considered a program under development. They pass this off as a feature rather than a bug and in theory it is but not they way that they do it. The company is overly compartmentalized which seems to be intentional to... Read More give any department the ability to pass the proverbial buck onto another department. Often you find that the materials lack in the way of pedagogy. In addition many of the instructors early in the program have not been given much in the way of training to educate students. The TA's have had less training in that regard from the start of the program to the end. An additional note on the TA's in some cases the TA's you will have will have graduated only days previous. I am not saying they are not capable software developers but there is a difference between being able to write code and being able to teach a person how to write code. aA will constantly try tweaking things to create ""improvements"" these improvements are often in good spirit but poorly thought out. Changes are not relayed from department to department, Instructors and TA's have not familiarized themselves with the new curriculum or the implementation of the improvement is just for lack of a way of saying it bad. This is normal when changes happen in a company, growing pains will happen of course. The problem with that is you as a student are only going to go through a portion of the program once or face deferral. If the portion of the program you are going through has had changes made to it for your iteration the mistakes made by the program are blamed on you and you face the consequences. Now those are the negative portions of aA. These are the positives, The staff in most cases care greatly for the students there are some exceptions to that through. The program will teach you how to write code. I started with absolutely no coding experience and made it through the program and feel comfortable calling myself a software developer. The program is great for a person who may not have the discipline to teach themselves. You will make deep and real friendships in the program. Words of advice to students considering aA. Don't expect aA to read your mind, you have to communicate with the staff. Get to know your PTM and Assistant PTM. They will be your rock through the program. Do not be afraid to give them real feedback on the program or things going on. They really do take it with grace and do care how you are doing. It is a Marathon and not a sprint.

"Coming from a non-traditional background as a musician with no college degree or work experience, App Academy seemed too good to be true. I'd always been interested in tech, but could a bootcamp really take me from nothing to software developer in 6 months?... Read More The answer is... Yes! BUT you have to be ready to put in a tremendous amount of passion, dedication, time, and effort. There's no magic secret to App Academy... It's just a lot of hard work. No one can learn to code for you, and no one can get a job for you... That's all on you! But App Academy provides you with all the tools and support you need, and it was a truly life changing experience for me. The core curriculum (as it was when I attended) is incredible - I can't praise it enough. You don't just learn web development frameworks, you learn how they work under the hood. The TA's are always willing to help you when you run into issues, no matter how long it takes. And your fellow cohort mates will be fun to work with! A lot of students (including myself) were dubious of pair programming in the beginning... And although it's not perfect, the pros far outweigh the cons. Communicating your code to others is a make-or-break skill in the job search, and pair programming is a great way to develop that skill. Some days of pairing will be better than others, but that's just life haha. If you're worried about the workload, don't be. Well ok... maybe worry a little haha. App Academy will keep you busy all day, every day for the entirety of the program, weekends included. This is especially true if you're striving for a deep understanding of the material (which you should be!). But learning software development is a fun and rewarding process, and although the workload was immense, I found it enjoyable. There will be times when you feel overwhelmed, but there's a strangely satisfying feeling that comes from being thrashed day after day after day haha. I think the most difficult part is the end of the course when you're building your own projects. I'm a perfectionist, so I put a lot of pressure on myself, and worked very long hours. I had no school or prior experience, so I knew my portfolio would be a critical part in showing off my abilities as a developer. Once projects are completed, you will move into the job search, which is a completely different challenge. You have to balance sending out plenty of applications, preparing for interviews and continuing to learn and grow as a developer. You will be responsible for structuring your days and holding yourself accountable, and it's really easy to get lazy and unmotivated (I know I did), especially when your pipeline is empty. Also, don't expect your career coach to get you a job - there's only so much they can do. To give some detailed job search stats, I sent out a total of 333 applications, which resulted in 8 phone screens, 3 coding challenges, 2 on-sites, and 1 job. I was extremely fortunate.All in all, App Academy was an amazing experience. However, it seems like App Academy is growing and changing, as all companies do. I can't say for certain if the experience of future cohorts will be the same as mine. I know the curriculum has been completely overhauled, and I'm not sure I would call it an improvement, based on what I've seen. It'll be up to you to decide if App Academy is the right choice, but I'm happy to say that it worked out very well for me, as well as many students before me. If you've made the decision to become a software engineer, App Academy is definitely worth consideration!Read Less"

"In this review, I'm going to cover some general questions based on my experience with the App Academy online cohort.1. Should you apply for a coding boot camp? I can't give you a straight answer for this because it depends on your situation. But in my... Read More case, it was worth it for me, since my goal was to learn about full-stack web development and software engineering to be as fast as possible. I think App Academy does a great job at that, and you will be surprised at how quickly you can learn here. It would have taken me far longer of self-studying to be where I'm at today. Not to mention, I've also made some great friends along the way that I talk to every day.2. How should one prepare before applying to App Academy? I did the intro-to-programming section offered on https://www.aaonline.io and felt that I was ready to schedule a technical interview with AA. I was not, I failed my first interview and was lucky enough to get invited back for another. After failing, I realized that I needed much more practice. I practiced on https://www.codewars.com every day up until my next interview. You need to time yourself and talk out loud through the problem-solving process, preferably to a friend or family member. You should also be very comfortable working with arrays and hashes in Ruby and solving problems that may require nested loops. Sidenote: https://www.leetcode.com is another excellent place to practice. 3. How many hours per week to get through the program? Like many have said before me, this boot camp is no joke. Even if you put in 80+ hours per week, you will only be scratching the surface of the topics covered. But this is the tradeoff of getting yourself job-ready as fast as possible.4. How stressful is the program? If you have no programming experience, you will need to study hard to pass the six assessments. They cover Ruby algorithms, Ruby Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, Ruby on Rails, React, and JavaScript. If you fail two of the assessment tests, you must retake one of their choosing. If you fail the retake test, you will be booted out. Yes, it's stressful, but keep your focus on the material and the great job that you're going to get out of it, and you'll be fine.5. How is the curriculum? I think that some of the newer content at the end of the curriculum could use some improvement. But for the most part, it's fantastic. I know some people may be turned off by Ruby and Ruby on Rails, but don't worry about it, you will also build full-stack applications with the MERN stack.6. How are the instructors? From my experience, they were knowledgable and friendly. Leave the ego at the door and pick their brains as much as possible. They are a valuable resource. 7. What is a day like at App Academy? At 8 AM we would meet on Zoom, the instructors would cover the daily material before splitting us up into random pairs to work on the day's projects. Throughout the day, we had access to the instructors to ask them questions. About an hour before the end of the day, we would all meet to cover the material in the day's project. Before the next day, we would then complete the assigned homework.Great experience and I would do it again.Read Less"
"Scroll through the other reviews, but stop Here.App Academy is hard, they tell you about not knowing the difficulty and it’s kind of true, the problem is the exams get longer and your more at risk of being behind so probably on average it does get harder.... Read More I don’t know why they say that but it’s probably rooted at the top level. This is what you need to know.To get into App Academy it will be pretty hard to just apply and pray...you need to Study. If you do study than look for the app academy problems online or go on GitHub(entry level) and search for them. Jumpstart can help if your background is weak(only couple months), but I certainly noticed an edge for those who did Boot Camp Prep(I didn’t and I was a little envious). So who Am I ? Well I just graduated Today...take my review with respect to that aspect of App Academy’s curriculum. Reviewing them is a little tough because everyone is different, some people pick it up faster(I’m diligent so it’s at what I call a normal pace) and others pick it up faster, but those people which will be in Your cohort have some type of strong technical background most likely. The tests are hard and it is true you can’t tell which one is the hardest normally due to the differences in people. They will overwork you on purpose and try to see if you can pass because if you can’t they want you to fail out. Part of the reason is the last ten days of the main part of the curriculum they let you work on the full stack, but it’s an extremely expensive operation and probably not profitable for them if you can’t do the basics of coding. Not to mention once you start the Full Stack project you need to be able to do it mostly on your own so you can put it on your Resume and say “I did that.” The best part? The Teacher assistants without a doubt. I was actually surprised at home many there are(around six plus the main instructor). The teacher assistants are highly skilled and during the course you will likely learn the most from them more than anything else. When you put it all together App Academy’s program is very good and costs quite a bit of capital to run, remember these teacher assistants are paid well. A couple of last notes. They are now like a well oiled machine. They hire in advance, train the next leaders before they leave, prep the next cohort as soon as you start yours, and they do not stop for whatever reason.....in App academy there are no days off and they work through almost all holidays. If you want to go to App Academy I recommend it. Better if you can pair it with a degree, but standalone it’s good too. If I was you and you were accepted I would not hangout on the weekends. I went to a wedding one day and felt behind the entire course because of it. There’s so much homework that catching up is really hard and the weekends are for studying the tests since it’s pointless to do the homework if you can’t pass the test. Overall four stars because of the lack of support for stressed out individuals. They say talk to us, but it’s not very inviting and I took it as a clue for an opportunity for them to say to you “this course is not for everyone.”Read Less"

I suggest taking note of the things that give you trouble and having questions prepared in advance to ask the staff in person. There's also a Slack channel where everyone can help each other out. After my first official day, I was surprised by how enthusiastic the everyone was! The culture at A/a really is amazing. All of the instructors and TAs are very patient and super nice.

"I was a part of the NYC March cohort (Mar - Jun 2018) and purposely waited to write my review until I accepted a job after completing the program.App Academy has changed my life; within 8 months, I quit my old non-technical job, took the course, went... Read More through interviewing and accepted a job as a software engineer (have been working for 1 month now). I think very favorably of the program overall, but want to provide some quick bullets to answer questions that I know I had when considering if App Academy was right for me:1. How long does it take to get a job after finishing the program? - I feel very fortunate in that I was connected with a company with an App Academy alum at my graduation night (the final week of the program) and wrapped up my interview cycle with them in 2 weeks. This is not the norm, though. Expect your search on average to take anywhere from 4-9 months.2. What is the average starting salary? - My offer was just shy of $100k at a company in New York City. Friends of mine from App Academy who have gotten jobs in the past few weeks have all been offered slightly more than me, but I hear the average range is closer to $85-90k for App Academy graduates in the New York area.3. What are the payment plan options? - There are 3 choices: (1 - upfront) $17k all up front, (2 - hybrid) $9k up front and $14k in scheduled payments after accepting a job, and (3 - deferred) $5k upfront and $23k in payments after accepting a job. For #s 2 and 3, how you pay off the larger second amount depends on your starting salary; if you sign the alumni engagement agreement (you agree to mentor future students and show up at a/A events), your tuition will be capped at either 23% (hybrid) or 28% (deferred) of your starting salary and you'll pay the lower of that amount or the written amount that you owe. For example, if you accept a starting salary of $85k and you have chosen the hybrid plan, you'd only have to pay $10.55k back instead of the full $14k. Your payment schedule depends on your starting salary as well, but expect to pay between $1500 and $2000 monthly until you've paid back what you owe. If you don't accept a job after a year from when the program ends and you've been looking with a good faith effort, you get your money back. 4. Does App Academy force me to take the first job I get? - No. You can choose to turn down offers that don't make sense for you, but I'm pretty sure if you do that and don't accept a job by the time the year after your program ends, you're still on the hook for tuition since you technically did get a job offer.5. Will I feel prepared to join the workforce as a software engineer when the program is up?- Imposter syndrome will tell you no, and that's not totally wrong. There is still so much that I want to learn about software development where I feel like I'm currently just scratching the surface. But, I do feel qualified for my current job. App Academy did a great job of teaching me both the fundamentals and how to learn things quickly that I don't know (Google is your friend! All developers, bootcamp or not, use it daily!). There's been nothing I've encountered at my job so far that I've had no idea how to handle.6. Who are the instructors?- The instructors are former App Academy students that most times are hired while they are still students, so they know the material very well but have not yet worked as developers outside of App Academy. The curriculum is developed by lead TAs who take the job very seriously and travel to conferences/attend meetups to make sure it is up-to-date and relevant.7. Who will my classmates be?- Students seem to vary in their backgrounds. Expect a cohort in NYC to be around 40 people though, and maybe 5 of them will have a CS degree. Closer to 1/3 might have previous light coding experience (SQL, basic JavaScript) from another job. 8. What languages will I learn and are they useful in the job market?- App Academy will teach you Ruby, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS as languages. More specifically, you'll learn Rails as a backend framework and React/Redux as frontend libraries to help you render web pages. Ruby is not used heavily anymore but is a great semantic starter language to help teach you how to code. React, from what I've seen, is where job demand is right now. My current team uses React.9. Is it really possible to be successful in this program with no coding background?- Yes. I had no coding background. That being said though, it takes a lot of work and determination to get up to speed. I did the JumpStart program through a/A which taught me coding basics for free after work over 4 weeks. Then once I was accepted, I meticulously when through the pre-cohort prep course (alpha course) before beginning classes. Take alpha seriously and make sure you understand it thoroughly; there's office hours for your questions.10. Cons?- It's a stressful environment where you can fail out if you don't pass 2 of the weekly exams. There are only 6 exams total so they don't last for your whole time in the program, but they are very high stress and require a strong ability to focus and mitigate any anxiety that this may induce for you. The prep resources are there to help you (there are always practice exams for you to take and TAs will occasionally have test walk-throughs to attend before the assessments) but you need to put the work in to succeed. My one complaint about App Academy is there is still room for improvement for how TA's provide emotional support to students who do not handle stress well. If that is you, you can still do this program - don't be discouraged! But you will have to go out of your way to ask for emotional support and feedback from your TAs and peers.Read Less"
"You know when you were a kid and you kind of thought your parents or grown ups had everything figured out? And then you grow up to realize they're pretty much winging it? Elements of App Academy feel a bit like that.To be clear, I really enjoyed App Academy... Read More and thought it was about as good as one could do trying to teach this amount of material in a very condensed period of time. But I don't think aA should remain complacent because there is definitely room for improvement. For instance, when you first arrive, you learn a bit about the TAs, some of whom may have just graduated from aA the week before. This isn't inherently a bad thing, but you do see a big disparity between TAs who have more experience and those that are hot off the presses for lack of a better term. This becomes more obvious the more you ask about topics that are tangentially related to the curriculum. I think the TAs on average tend to nail topics related to every day's projects, but if you're looking for a resource to widen your understanding of some technologies you may find yourself slightly disappointed depending on who you ask. The next element I took issue with is the check-in structure. I want to emphasize this: bootcamp students are adult humans. App Academy has a thrice daily check-in (by 9, 1:10-1:130, 3:55-4:00) that must be done on their internet to confirm that you're there. On one hand--I get it because we do pair programming for most of the day and missing out on the pairing screws over your partner for the day. On the other hand, we don't need to be treated like elementary school students and should be given at least a LITTLE more license over our education. This isn't likely to change anytime soon, so if it seems overbearing to you, keep that in mind.Assessments. The assessments are necessary but flawed... one one hand, you need to make sure students are really keeping up with their understanding of the material because if you don't understand each week or day's subject matter, you're setting yourself up for failure in the coming weeks. That said, the assessments aren't so dynamic that you can't just read the specs, learn the patterns, and pass the assessments without fundamentally understanding the core concepts. All this is to say that students that don't have a great understanding of the material can sneak through the system by memorizing patterns needed for assessments. I think they could stand to be recalibrated.The curriculum is excellent but the project instructions vary pretty drastically from day to day. Some days the projects feel clear as day and the instructions step through the material in a way that puts you and your partner in the driver's seat giving you the appropriate amount of hints/code. Other days the instructions feel really really open ended and make far too many assumptions about our prior knowledge. I could continue to nitpick details about App Academy, but at the end of the day, the students are bright, motivated, and the environment is extremely positive and supportive. While the work load at times can feel overwhelming, the TAs and your fellow students are always there to help. I would recommend App Academy to just about anybody looking to quickly get from 0 to 100 as a web developer and I would encourage aA to never stop improving.Read Less"

"I’ve thought about this day, the day I would write my review of App Academy, for a very long time. In the weeks before my cohort started I read many of these reviews in search of clues that would help me know what to expect and how to succeed. Wondered... Read More if I would ever get the opportunity to write one. Promised myself that I would only contribute to the pile if I made it all the way through the final and ultimate challenge: getting a job.I start Monday, so here goes.App Academy is a fucking rollercoaster and during moments of frustration, satisfaction, hope, despair, pride, humility, fun, fatigue, laughter, and crying I often thought: “MY FINGER IS ON THE MEDIUM POST”. Okay, that was only for the bad times. For both the good and the bad the thought was: “this is going in the review”. I can’t recall all of what I intended to say during those moments now and a Knausgaard-esque stream-of-consciousness account of my App Academy experience is not what these review sites are for. So I will organize my thoughts into categories and bullet points for maximum skimability.GENERAL:- Yes, you do work the crazy hours they say you do. I generally went to bed around midnight and was up at 7 or 8AM. 85-95 hours a week is accurate.- No, they are not scared of kicking people out. My cohort lost like 20 or 25+%? It can be emotional losing people you befriended. It is depressing seeing people who worked hard have to leave. A lot of it can seem like chance. Anxiety, illness, fatigue, or just having a bad day can make the difference between a pass or a fail. Your best defense against any of these factors bringing you down is simply to study extremely hard for the tests.- Yes, there is a deposit they don’t tell you about. - No, App Academy is not a scam. GOOD:- The TAs. They are all intelligent, articulate, and helpful. You get assigned a TA as an advisor/mentor and mine was above-and-beyond supportive and awesome (shoutout to Anastassia).- The other students. App Academy attracts a smart bunch of people from all sorts of different backgrounds. Seriously, everyone is so smart. It’s easy to bond with people and make friends when you are all going through the same crazy experience.- The Ruby and Rails curriculum (first 4 weeks) is excellent.- For me the full-stack project was the highlight of App Academy. It’s rewarding to see everything you have learned come together to create something real. And it feels great to be able to make your own direction and have some creative freedom.- You learn React which is hot right now and a big asset when on the job search.- App Academy was my only option when it came to bootcamps for financial reasons. It sounds corny but it felt like someone believed in me and was willing to put money behind it. This was encouraging and motivating during the hard times.- Practicing interviewing during the job search helped my anxiety and performance during interviews.BAD:- The JavaScript curriculum is a dumpster fire. It's like a hastily-assembled Sunday night book report. Whoever made it seems to have Googled around for definitions of various JavaScript concepts then stitched them together into new documents so App Academy could say it had its OWN JavaScript curriculum. Had to unlearn and relearn lots of JS later on.- There’s something to be said for all-JS bootcamps like Hack Reactor if you want to be a front-end dev (like me). But I also appreciated learning programming fundamentals in a language like Ruby where I am purely focused on problem-solving.- The pace and the learning style is not for everyone. I do not learn best through lectures and it takes a little bit of time for new concepts to settle in. So I found myself writing TONS of notes during lectures and asking for one-on-one help from TAs or other students when I needed it.- Parts of the job search can be very one-size-fits-all. I get why it is this way and that there needs to be accountability but it could be frustrating.- Algorithms lectures at the end of the course feel like trying to cram 4 years of CS concepts into your brain in two weeks. Lots of room for improvement in the instruction and the structure.- Constant stress, feeling like the dumbest person on earth because you are around such smart people, beating up your body from long computer hours.- Tehama.TIPS:- DO THE PREP WORK. Do it twice. Study with other people before you start. You want to come into this strong and passing the first few assessments puts you in a far less stressful situation.- Do the practice assessments a million times. Especially if you are a slower or weaker student like me. Don’t slack on the weekend! If you drill hard all weekend you probably will not fail.- Sleep. Your brain needs it to work right.- Ask about deposit assistance if you cannot afford the full $5k deposit. There are some diversity scholarships and other ways you can work it out with them.- If you get the opportunity to do JumpStart for your admissions process I highly recommend it.Read Less"
"I just finished the main portion of AppAcademy's full-time bootcamp in NYC (i.e. week 9 out of the full 12 weeks). I came into the program with about a year of experience tinkering with Ruby, Javascript, and Python, and some background in logic, and a... Read More long history of playing around with computers, but no academic CS background. My academic background is in the humanities (philosophy and theology) and I spent the first six years after college in grad school, then teaching, then working at a small magazine. The course is extremely intense. (I say this as someone who graduated in the top 10% of my class at Yale.) About 25% of my cohort was asked to leave because they couldn't keep up with the pace. That said, the instructors do a good job of helping you through each day, and the structure of the course itself, from one day to the next, is very thoroughly regimented. If you do the course, I recommend surrendering to the routine as much as possible. There is always more work to do—you will almost never finish a day's projects. The name of the game is to struggle for 14+ hours, get some sleep, and then struggle again the next day. You will work on weekends, you will not have a day off before week ten (and if you think you do, you're probably making a mistake). If you can keep up, you will find that the rate of your learning is really high.A typical day goes as follows: you arrive at the office by ~8:45am in advance of the morning checkin and go to your assigned seat for the day, with your partner for the day. 9 - 9:30am is spent doing a CSS exercise. 9:30 to about noon is spent in lecture (lectures have built-in Q&amp;A time, and a five minute break in the middle). Lectures cover everything from O(n) and implementing backend Auth to meta-programming in Ruby and state structure design in Redux. Lectures are generally reinforcement of the essential concepts from the previous night's readings and homework. This means they tend to be more basic, and more Q&amp;A oriented than the readings—as a result they can feel boring if you understood the readings right away, but the reinforcement is essential. At 12:30 there's a lunch break, which continues until 1:45pm. Some people work on homework during lunch, but the instructors encourage students to take the time to have a break. At 1:45 there's another checkin, after which you resume work with your partner, starting the day's projects. There are usually two or three projects, the first one deals with implementing the concepts in the day's lecture, and then the subsequent projects tend to be more advanced extensions of the same material. You will rarely get through the second project of the day. Many days you won't even finish the first. At 6pm an instructor dismisses the class and makes any announcements or reminders. After 6pm about 1/4 of the cohort will stay behind to complete their homework at the office. Most people go home to do the homework, which is usually ~3 hours, depending on the number of recorded lecture segments and readings. After finishing the homework, students are expected to review the solutions to the day's projects, and read through the next day's project instructions in advance.That's life for the first 7 weeks of the course. Assessments are usually on Mondays or Wednesdays. They're terrifying, very difficult to prepare for, and intense, but if you do what the instructors tell you to do to study, and use the provided resources, the test itself should go fine. In the 8th week the typical lecture/project/homework schedule goes away and students spend about 10 days doing individual full-stake projects. This building a production-ready clone of a major web application (facebook, airbnb, etc.) from scratch, on your own. Project presentations happen at the end of week 9, after which the jobsearch curriculum begins. This is three weeks of lecture, independent projects, application/interview prep, etc. (That's where I'm at right now). If I remember, I'll come back and update this review once some time passes so I can assess the program in light of its key promise: to help you get an engineering job. As things stand, it could hardly have been better, except in minor ways here and there (a few unclear assignments, a few weak lectures), but as a learning experience it's up in the top experiences of my life. Totally practical, radically empowering. I learned a lot. And continue to learn about as much in the past two months as I think I could have.Read Less"
"DISCLAIMER: I will be getting a hoodie from App Academy for writing this review, but the content of the review will not be influenced by this ‘reward’I came to App Academy with a limited background in Computer Sciences and STEM fields and, 9 weeks into... Read More the program, have come out with a complete entry-level knowledge of full-stack development. The resources that have helped me from getting from point A to B in such a short amount of time was the rigor and depth of a/A’s curriculum. The most important reason is that the curriculum is so effective is that class-time enforces students to be immersed in programming and coding challenges for a maximum amount of time. The pair-programming aspect of the curriculum is a strong way to enforce communication skills and forces students to have a deeper understanding of new lessons when they are encouraged to explain their thought-process to their peers. The quality of said peers is also generally excellent in terms of character and ability. While pairing chemistry will never be perfect between every student, it was always evident to me that my peers took their time in the program very seriously and were always concerned with learning the material deeply, preparing for each class adequately, and producing high-quality work. The teaching staff is also generally excellent. I found that the quality of individual instructors would often correlate to their time in the program, but because the curriculum is so intense, the more junior instructors themselves also appear to improve quite rapidly. While there was sometimes a quality gap between new and veteran instructors, the actual time-difference between the former and the latter was usually only a cohort or two. And generally, I found that the entire package of TAs, who do all of the teaching at App Academy, was excellent and foundational to my own learning in the program.As for the cons, the largest is definitely the intense and disheartening aspects of the assessment structure of the curriculum. Personally, the assessments were the most important reason that I spent so much time working and studying outside of class hours. This is because if you fail two assessments, plus a single retake opportunity, you are dismissed from the course. With a weekend full of intense studying, I personally found the assessments to be fair and the course will give preparation materials that strongly correspond to the actual assessment. On the other hand, sometimes peers cannot make it through the grind of assessments: I believe that these individuals that were dismissed from the program do have the potential to be good programmers in the working world, and it was likely the pace of the curriculum, more so than its sheer technical difficulty, that was the largest hump to get over. Overall, my advice to prospective future students is that if you are confident in your programming abilities coming into the first week of the program, expect to still spend a lot of time on assessments and digesting the enormous amount of material from the week prior. If you are coming in less-confident, or even worse, having rushed through the four weeks of prep work, then expect to spend an extraordinary amount of time (and lack of sleep) on keeping your head above water. While the assessment structure does force students to master the material, for the most part, the stressful atmosphere that it creates through the whole school is an unfortunate trade-off.Finally, I wanted to comment on the quality of the facilities, which is important because students spend most of their hours here. During my cohort, the New York office got a significant upgrade in amenities and privacy. Before, both concurrent cohorts shared a single loft space with poor water pressure, mediocre bathrooms, and sometimes inconsistent internet. Now, each cohort gets their own floor to work on, and the office space includes a decent kitchen setup outfitted with utensils, plateware, drinking mugs/glasses, and a dishwasher. Most importantly, the coffee and teas offered by the building were significant upgrades over Folgers and Lipton. These small touches, for me, actually made a tremendous quality-of-life improvement; since most of our time will be in front of screens in the office, it’s good that the peripheral comforts are well-appointed.All-in-all I would recommend App Academy to those who want to make a tremendous career shift to a good field in the least amount of time possible. My warnings are regarding its pace, difficulty, and the toll it can take on your personal well-being.Read Less"
"Let me say in advance that I think the program itself is superb. The Teaching Assistants all know what they're talking about, and are very good at answering your questions and clarifying your understanding of things. The course material is all excellent,... Read More and by the end of the course, you'll have a strong understanding of vanilla javascript, ruby, rails, and using it all together to create an app or service from scratch. AA does a great job teaching ruby, rails, React + Redux, and putting it all together in a final package.However, while the material is all superb, the downside is the extreme pacing and difficulty. You will easily do 12-14 hour days of non-stop coding, studying, etc (with the occasional breaks for sanity, of course). I would only recommend this program if you feel that you are completely prepared for the sheer intensity of the program. You learn a lot, and you have to learn it fast. If you fall behind, material quickly snowballs, and you'll be left behind. I cannot stress enough how important time management, and being prepared for the workload, is for to get the most out of this experience.Having a very good grasp of ruby, javascript, and a basic understanding of how the internet works, will help a lot to prepare for what you'll encounter. Prior experience helps a lot. If you aren't good at typing at a decently fast pace, practice. Make sure you're fully prepared before coming in, or else you might be in for a rude awakening.Read Less"
"App Academy is terrific. I almost failed out of App Academy due to failing assessments, and spent more time job searching than most of my classmates. But because I had a really solid support system, from the friends I made to the job placements team,... Read More I finally secured a job that I'm excited about. Back when I started in September 2016, if you failed two assessments, you were kicked out of the program. I was a pretty poor test taker due to high anxiety. When I failed my second assessment, I prepared my things and said my goodbyes. Thankfully, App Academy scheduled a retake, and I aced it. Now, I hear the retake policy is more lenient. My advice: take the practice assessments as many times as you can, and the chances of failing are much lower. I spent 10 months searching for a job. When I started my job search, my soft skills were weak, and my technical skills needed a lot of improvement. I practiced around 3 times a week doing practice interviews and white-boarding with my friends using Skype. My coach taught me how to sound prepared and confident on the phone, and checked on me weekly to see how I was doing with my job applications. The job search team also schedules mandatory workshops for job-seeking graduates to learn new skills and review concepts. They provide a really comprehensive list of networking events and meetups in the Bay Area where you can meet potential recruiters and other engineers. They're also some of the nicest people I've met; sometimes they'll just chat with you in the hallway and ask how you're doing. They always make sure they're available if you ever have any questions.Read Less"
"When I started looking at different boot camps I was already taking online open courseware classes. There were three main things I was looking for that I could not get self-teaching. The first was coding with other people - App Academy focuses heavily... Read More on pairing and you will pair for the majority of the day every single day for the first seven weeks. The second factor was having people actually look at and critique my code, as online code checkers really tell you nothing about code quality, only code correctness at best. This was addressed with pairing, TA code reviews, lectures on best practices, and studying the provided daily solutions. Lastly, I knew that I would seriously need help in the job search. This was the real kicker, as App Academy's tuition model of paying a percentage of your first year's salary really gave me confidence that I would be supported and pushed throughout the job search process. I'm happy to say that really was exactly my experience. On my own, I never would have pushed myself to apply so quickly and to so many places, but with App Academy's support I ended up nabbing a Software Engineer position I am super excited about in almost exactly three months after starting to apply, which is the average time. The stats are real! (Salary stats, too)Overall I was very impressed with the structure of the program, so much is really thought through in advance. The admission process mirrors job search, and the tests serve not only to ensure you keep up with the pace but also are great preparation for timed coding challenges in interviews. I would definitely suggest studying a lot in advance and making sure you are strong in your fundamentals. The provided a/A material is really the bare minimum, I took CS50x and MIT 6.001x and would highly recommend them. If you are not prepared for the first weeks it is nearly impossible to catch up and I would say most people who fail out do so because they were not sufficiently prepared. Also, if you have sufficient time, I would recommend spending some time to learn algorithms in advance as you will have a ton of things on your plate during job search.Read Less"

This practical approach enables students to apply their learning to tangible projects, fostering a deeper understanding of software engineering principles and best practices. The platform also facilitates interaction and collaboration among students through online forums and peer feedback, creating an engaging and dynamic learning environment. One aspect that could benefit from improvement is the availability of more advanced and specialized courses within the software engineering domain. While the existing curriculum covers fundamental concepts and popular programming languages, expanding into advanced topics, such as software architecture, algorithms, or specific frameworks, would further enhance the platform's appeal to experienced software engineers seeking to deepen their knowledge. Springboard's learning platform is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy to navigate through the course materials. The content is well-structured, with clear explanations and comprehensive resources. Additionally, the platform provides a variety of learning resources, including video lectures, reading materials, coding exercises, and quizzes, which cater to different learning styles and preferences.

"It was a correct decision to learn at the Data Science Career Track program at Springboard, as I finally started getting responses from employers. On one of the applications I was one step away from employment. This course helps boost your chances and... Read More compete with those who has formal specialized education, such as in computer science or data science. While a lack of formal experience through employment is still a problem, it is somewhat alleviated by the hands-on curriculum projects and the projects done after completing the course. In my feeling, completing this course gives you a credibility. There are three main components: career coaching by people experienced in technical recruiting, mentorship by data scientists working in industry, and well organized tutorial materials. In my opinion, it would be very hard for a self-learner to achieve such pace and quality of learning. Having to pay disciplines and ensures a good pace of learning. Not everyone gets a good mentor. My two advices here are: 1) change the mentor if he behaves like he is your boss and only demands, and you need to spend a lot of time just to think what questions are good and bad. This could be OK only in the beginning. 2) Stick to the one who is genuinely willing to help. Springboard allows to switch to another mentor, they have some long-term selection in place. Most career coaches are very helpful, you can meet with them roughly every week. Here my suggestion is to stay organized: write their suggestions and execute on the same day, because otherwise you will find it difficult to get back to it due to a lot of main technical learning which keeps piling up if you are not as organized. Make sure to agree with your family members: they will miss you a lot 6 to 9 months, because they will mostly see your back while you are sitting at the computer. The skills you get are worth it, but there is still a long job search ahead after graduation in most cases. Delve deeply into material, as there are four mock up interviews close to the end of the course. The best ways to prepare for Data Science course is to learn Python, Statistics, and SQL in advance, and try to craft a resume and LinkedIn profile. At the end, you learn how to extend your network, data analysis, and machine learning. Only basic familiarity with statistics and SQL, but there are many resources in the curriculum, which you can use for training, including after graduation. No exposure to cloud techniques, but you will become prepared to play with those on your own. Up to two breaks are allowed, up to 3 weeks each, which helps make it in time if you like to delve deeper or have a lack of prior experience.Read Less"

My only wish is that it was delivered in a different format so that I could have used my phone to work on it instead of having to be at my computer for it. The mentor experience and career services are absolutely top notch for Springboard. My wife had a baby in the middle of my cohort, and Springboard allowed my to pause for a very generous amount of time with 0 repercussions to the job guarantee or completion.

"The most valuable part of Springboard is the weekly mentoring sessions. I learned the most from my mentor and got individualized feedback. Springboard will also accommodate your mentor requests.

The career counselors and other mentors have all given insightful feedback. I always came away from mentoring sessions with actionable steps for improvement. I also appreciate how accommodating Springboard is with timeline. It was difficult for me to balance the boot camp alongside my full time job and other commitments, but I worked with my wonderful student advisor to come up with an extended timeline at no additional cost. Springboard also provided mental health services for qualifying students which was also a great perk. The only negative experience I had with Springboard was that you cannot switch out of your assigned Industry Design Program (IDP) project. I wanted to switch projects to work with an established company with cross-functional teams as my assigned stakeholder was a freelancer, however, Springboard could not make this accommodation. I let them know why their description of the IDP is misleading as you may not be paired with an established company. Overall, I am very pleased with the program and it was well worth the tuition.Read Less"
"Software Engineering is a challenging practice that requires a lot of determination and a genuine love of learning (you should love coding outside your job and learning the latest technologies). I found success in this program because I spent a few years... Read More making sure that software engineering was a career I would enjoy before joining this program by talking to developers I worked with and taking some programming classes. I think that sometimes boot camps can be a trap for some people new to programming, so before you join one make sure to talk to developers not just about what they love about their career but the challenging and realistic day-to-day challenges. The mentorship program and the number of projects I added to my GitHub portfolio made this program worthwhile for me and helped me find my first opportunity. I'm so thankful I made the leap to advance my career, but keep in mind software development isn't for everyone.Read Less"
"When I started this program I had no knowledge of computer programs at all. I was a former cake designer. With the help of my mentor, career coach, and advisor I was able to learn skills I thought I would never understand. Pros for Springboard Bootcamp:... Read More you have 1 on 1 mentor time and receive feedback and direction for improvement. Career coaching is a bonus where they show you how to find jobs as well as what to expect from hiring managers. The school allows you to move through the material at your own pace and encourages you to do as much as you can each week by setting goals. Cons for Springboard is it is just a certificate. So far I have been told I need a bachelor's degree from all the places I have applied to. I disagree with needing that so I am pushing forward and continuing to try other companies as well as work on other projects for my portfolio.Read Less"
"I recently completed the UX/UI bootcamp at Springboard and overall, I had a great experience! The course allowed me to learn at my own pace and I had a rockstar mentor who guided me through it and prepped me to enter the industry. There's room for improvement... Read More but for the most part, I think Springboard has a competent curriculum. PROS: -No mandatory classes/lectures allows you to work at your own speed (up to 9 months to complete the course) -Majority of curriculum isn't proprietary material (lots of curated articles and videos) meaning it's easy to update with more current info -Curriculum seems to get updated relatively frequently -Proprietary curriculum material is excellent -1-on-1 mentorship lets you explore work in-depth and get thorough feedback -Unlimited mentor calls on demand if you need extra help -Thorough career support even if you don't qualify for the job guarantee (I didn't but I was able to find work!) -Projects prepare you well for real design work -Opportunity to work with a company for ~4 weeks provides hands-on job experience before you graduate CONS: -Currently not much support for building relationships with classmates/fostering community within your cohort -No lectures/classes requires students to structure their time effectively on their own (they do provide a lot of material to help) -Mentors can be hit and miss. I had a great experience with mine but I know that hasn't been true of every student -Industry Design Project needs more structure and supportRead Less"
"Overall, I really love Springboard and it was personally a really great fit for me. Overall: This program was a lot of work. I thought I would finish well before the nine months...I did not. Realistically, I had a full time job and was taking this course... Read More and I would say that their suggestion of nine months is very accurate. It also allows you time to circle back to old projects and improve them and really let your brain be the awesome sponge it is and absorb all it can. I got real feedback on my projects from hiring managers, career coaches, and my mentor, all of which were actually rigorous and making sure your work is up to standard. As the title says, If you stick with Springboard and really actively try to improve your skills, I got a job before I even finished the program with my new skills (and a good one at that). Pros: - My mentor was my absolute lifeline and made the program feel ""real"" which for me, as someone who avoids social activity at all cost, was huge because I had to talk to her weekly making sure I had something I could bring to her to talk about every week. Basically, I'm the kind of person who goes ""all-in"" on something for like two months and then forgets about it and drops it, my mentor was the core component of that not happening. - The support system is great - Sometimes I think things like career coaches, mentors, etc. are overrated, but I was surprised at how much value I actually got from these mandatory meetings I would have otherwise passed on. Room for improvement: - My IDP (real job experience) wasn't great, but Springboard staff was extremely helpful in navigating the situation, I would say my IDP experience was more or less a rare experience and other Springboard students seem to have had a great one. I wouldn't really expect to get a job from the IDP if you had any hopes in that. However, the career coaches at the end of the program will be very helpful to you in finding a job so no worries there. I would say, even if you don't have the best IDP experience, it's still job experience to put on your resume which is huge. - Its very easy to just say you completed the reading by checking the box without actually doing it, I would love to see some sort of short quiz that verifies you went over the material incorporated into the program even if it isn't graded, just some sort of feedback to myself that I should go back and read more carefully. In Summary: I've talked to other people from other bootcamp programs who don't have nearly as good outcome as springboard. A lot of them are six months out still looking for jobs and (with peace and love) don't have nearly as solid case studies (in some cases these programs don't even make you do case studies which are ESSENTIAL in landing a job) ...as Springboard students.Read Less"
"I appreciated that Springboard was so considerate of their students—offering pauses to accommodate varying work/life situations and always being willing to help out. The curriculum was engaging and Springboard does a great job overall of making students... Read More feel like they've grasped the material and have people to reach out to for support if needed. They also make sure you have the appropriate job materials in place (LinkedIn, resume, elevator pitch, web portfolio...) and have had a chance to practice mock interviews to prepare you for your job search. What I would offer for improvement would be the portrayal of the job guarantee. I think it would be great if Springboard was more directly involved in connecting students with internships, relevant resources, or even potential employers based on their background, interests, and demonstrated success while working through the curriculum (The IDP project is not quite an internship). At first, this is what I thought was meant by job guarantee but I realized when attending the coaching calls that the student is expected to build a network on their own and try to find people who will be willing to do informational interviews with them and then try to leverage those connections. This is fine, but a bit different from what I thought would be provided and I think that if Springboard was more proactively involved in helping students connect with relevant people or resources that could turn into opportunities this would make their program even stronger and the job guarantee more compelling.Read Less"
"After doing a ton of research on UX bootcamps, I chose Springboard because it met the most criteria. Overall, I am happy with the education I got from this program. However, I was fortunate to be involved with 2 study groups of great individuals (one... Read More I was invited to, one I started) that met weekly for 1 hour on skype and were great about sharing resources. I also had a good mentor that I got along well with, and began meeting with career coaches early and often. Pros of this program: • The curriculum is well-structured and covers a wide expanse of UX methodology • The program is set up to give you some breathing room - although it is structured for 9 months, it actually allows for almost 12 months to complete • The mentoring and career coaching pieces are really valuable, and each student will have a unique mentor along with access to unlimited mentors • Your student advisor will support and advocate for you • I feel very confident in what I have learned and have gotten confirmation that I'm adding value to the company I'm working for now • You will get out of this program what you are willing to put in - if you are smart and strategic about the methods you use and the work you make, it will work for you Cons of this program: • The impetus is totally on the student to be responsible for their own learning - if you are someone that needs a teacher to walk you through new ideas, tools, and techniques, this is not the program for you • The estimated 17 hrs work/week is unrealistic if you are working full-time, have a family, or other life obligations beyond this program. The program does work with you so you can complete, but it probably won't be in 9 months (think about this with your payment structure) • There are some poorly structured deliverables that definitely feel like working harder, not smarter. Look ahead at the curriculum, especially once you start putting together your case studies, and build toward your portfolio (not google documents). • Some of the resources are outdated • It can be difficult to find any available times to schedule meetings with career coaches and/or unlimited mentors Springboard isn't perfect - nothing is. However, though there is room for improvement, I feel good about my decision to complete this bootcamp and what I have to show for my time and learning.Read Less"
"When I started my Springboard class in December 2019, I could rightly have never expected the following year to be what it was, no one could. I began the course because at the time I had more free time and time spent working and chose to use that free... Read More time to advance my UX skills so I'd be able to land a job in the field I actually wanted to be in. Then Covid hit and suddenly my work took off, my UX Springboard course quickly fell by the wayside given how busy I was with work. Despite needing much more time than the original 9 months to complete the course Springboard was there at every turn, offering me pauses, freezes, month extensions, etc. They really went above and beyond to help me finish my course so I could maintain my job guarantee. The mentorship program was also incredibly helpful, while mine got off to a rough start with a mentor who missed our very first call, Springboard quickly replaced them with one who would go on to be an invaluable resource for the rest of my time with them.Read Less"
"I was an accountant for 6 years and decided I was unhappy in it so I pursued Software Engineering for better work/life balance (among other things). I did Springboard from March 2020 - May 2021 (took multiple breaks). I started applying to jobs on May... Read More 30, 2021 and only interviewed with 1 company (1 phone screen and 1 virtual onsite) and received/accepted an offer yesterday, June 17, 2021, as a Software Engineer I. What convinced me to choose Springboard (in order of importance to me): 1. Flexibility - While I would rather go to an in-person classroom style bootcamp, I didn't want to do those 3-month intensive bootcamps where I had no time for anything else. Springboard provides remote learning and therefore, this teaching model wasn't affected by COVID (I applied in Feb 2020 and started in March 2020) and even prepares you for a remote job afterward, if that's your goal. 2. Instructor is good - If you want to see if you like his style, take Colt Steele's Udemy Web Developer Bootcamp course or check out his Youtube channel. 3. Job guarantee - if you don't get a job within 6 months (I think with COVID, it's now a year) of graduating the course, you get a full refund. Be aware there are still requirements to follow in order to qualify to get the refund. 4. Accountability - weekly 1:1s with a paired mentor who is a professional in the industry 5. The topics the bootcamp covers are pretty extensive 6. Price - Given the amount of material, support, and timeframe, the price is way better than those 3 month intensive bootcamps. I chose the month to month payment plan, but if you can afford it, just pay upfront. After taking the course, here are my pros/cons: Pros: - Flexibility (see above) - Accountability - I had a really great and supportive mentor throughout the entire course. However, you can switch mentors if you want. - Multiple Break Options - Pause(s)/Freeze for when life gets abnormally busy or you need a break from the course. Both options push your deadline date. - 2 Live Code Reviews with mentors who are not your regular mentor - Really supportive student advisers, who can be an extra accountability point - Semi-weekly office hours (curriculum-related and general questions for student advisers as well) - recorded so you can reference whenever - There's a lot of material and you get so much practice with tons of projects and exercises with ""further study"" sections - 10 assessments that are reviewed by your mentor + 2 capstone projects - TAs are available via chat during normal business hours - Career office hours (go over topics related to resume, Linkedin, networking, etc.) - recorded so you can reference whenever - 8 career coach calls/check-ins - Placements team to help send job opportunities to your inbox closer to when you are completing the course (I believe this team was created in 2021) - They care a lot about their students - They ask for a lot of feedback from students and will make changes or improvements that make sense. - Everyone is so nice and supportive Cons: - Interview readiness: Interviewing was probably what I felt least prepared for at the end of the curriculum. If you are making the switch into software engineering, you need to know now that interviewing is a whole different ballgame than the actual job itself. Some software engineers go to interviewing bootcamps JUST to prepare for interviewing. It's one thing to know how to code and problem solve, but to also be able to talk through your thought process AND have your code work or have to figure out bugs in your code while someone is watching -- interviewing can be really stressful. I was super lucky because I have a software engineer friend that practiced with me every night for 1.5 months to help me prep for the MOCK interviews, and I ended up still not passing my first attempt at the coding mock interview (I think I had been practicing with my friend for a month already at that point). In addition to practicing with my friend, I even scheduled 1 practice mock interview with Springboard before attempting and ultimately passing my second official coding mock interview. FYI if you don't pass within 2 tries, you no longer qualify for the job guarantee - so at the time, it felt like high stakes to me. However, this shouldn't have been the focus (see Tips below). I also understand that not everyone has a friend that they can practice with every night and get valuable feedback (yes, I know she's a very good friend), so I think Springboard needs more support in this area where students can choose to practice with a live person however many times they want, in advance, to prepare for the coding and white-boarding mock interviews. - Pretty new curriculum, including policies and procedures: At least at the time that I started, they were still figuring out kinks/bugs in the curriculum so the exercises could change shortly after you do them (this happened to me) but there wouldn't be any notification about it. Now that they have hired more people, the communication is better about this sort of thing. While the changes can be annoying, this is also a good thing because that means they care about their curriculum and students and are always looking for ways to improve. They have also made a lot of updates and come out with new documentation around their policies and procedures. You as a student just need to go with the flow. - Every time you have a question or have a bug that you can't figure out, uploading your code to Google Drive or GitHub and then having to type out your issues/questions to the TA in a little chat box can be really annoying but this also gives you training on what it's like to work remotely - Although, I think in work settings, it's more likely that you would be able to have a quick meeting and share your screen. I know Springboard is trying to work on a solution to this, but this also isn't the end of the world. I can see that it's probably much easier to ask a question in person/be in a class setting for when you do have questions. - No new friends (at least for me): You don't really get to know your cohort that well unless you take initiative and be really social online - but to put it bluntly, I'm older and I'm not doing this to make friends haha. Everyone in my cohort/online did seem really nice and I knew people in my cohort who made individual study groups or paired up, but this just wasn't my thing ONLY because I already had a friend who was taking the UI/UX bootcamp with Springboard (she was probably ahead of me by 6 months) and we were each other's accountability buddies, and that was really helpful. Even after she graduated, we could keep each other accountable on her job search and my progress with Springboard. I understand that this is rare though so if you want to socialize and make study groups with your cohort, by all means, do that. Tips: - I'm not sure if this is still the case, but when I enrolled they let us access the curriculum 2 weeks before our cohort start date, and the deadline to decide if you want a refund is 2 weeks after the cohort start date. This is basically 1 full month where you get access to the curriculum to try it out. If you're on the fence about choosing Springboard and you're not in a rush to do the bootcamp, enroll in a cohort date late enough so that you get this 1 month trial. - Keep in mind that the point is to NOT get a refund, the point is to get a job with your new awesome skills. - With self-pacing learning, it's important to stay disciplined but stay healthy. Stick to a schedule. Turn off distractions. Make sure to eat well, drink water, exercise, and get plenty of sleep. You can't perform your best if your health goes down the drain. This is for your mental health too. - Take breaks if you need them! - If you don't think the weekly 1:1 mentor calls are enough, get an accountability buddy - could be from your cohort or could be a friend. - Reach out to your student advisor because they are super helpful and can keep you accountable too. - Career changes are DIFFICULT! Find your ""why"" and remind yourself of it when you're feeling unmotivated. Or better yet, look at it every day or week. - Do your best. Don't give up. Keep a positive attitude. It's a marathon, not a sprint. If you fall down, get back up again.Read Less"
"I recently wrapped up the Springboard UX Career Track. I can't say enough good things about the curriculum or the mentors. My talents were stretched and expanded in meaningful ways through the course, and the exercises were extremely helpful in building... Read More the knowledge base necessary for a career in UX. Springboard is mentor led, and the mentor who guided me through the end of the course was a great voice for insights into improving my portfolio and representing myself professionally. The industry design project internship gave me an opportunity to put these skills into real life practice and make measurable impact at a company. You can't ask for more than that in a six month program. The weak link in the chain is career services. During my stint, I had some great career service calls where invaluable advice was provided, a couple of middling calls where it seemed like the coach needed to go through a script, and a no-show. To me, this isn't a deal breaker. I've been in the workforce for a decade now, and I know my strengths, my weaknesses, and how to represent them in the hiring process. UX-minded folks out of college, though, will want to be tenacious with advocating for themselves with job coaches. Again, there are really wonderful coaches on the Springboard roster. TL;DR - It's a good course! While career services could use improvement, the curriculum, mentors, and internship portions are stellar.Read Less"

Some students I have seen get offered full time positions at their industry design project-I worked full time alongside the course and so I was able to get a 2 month extension for free (so I did the course for 8 months total), I also got a couple of weeks off to catch up after a vacation (at no charge)Cons-It was a lot of work to do the course while working full time. It's possible, but it was definitely demanding.

"After completing the program and securing a job, I wanted to come back and review Springboard again after experiencing their job search program. In terms of curriculum, I overall enjoyed Springboard’s curriculum and learned a lot. The Harvard lectures... Read More are very informative and good for understanding machine learning theory. I do feel that their SQL curriculum is not very strong and could be improved, my SQL skills were poor when I finished the bootcamp. I also feel like there should be more information about basic Python coding - I had coding interviews that I was not prepared for. The two capstone projects are definitely the strongest aspect of Springboard and the aspect that got me the furthest in the interview process. Having projects to talk about really helped me in my initial interviews. My mentor who helped me with my projects was really nice and helpful! One thing that is a little sketchy that you should be aware of before you join: as part of the job guarantee, you are required to pass several mock interviews, and you only get two chances to pass each one. This did not impact me, but it is not something that is disclosed before you start the bootcamp. I was pretty satisfied with Springboard’s curriculum, but what I was completely unprepared for was the competitiveness of the job market. It’s tough to get interviews with no experience, and when you do get interviews, you have to be perfect or they will just find someone more qualified than you. I struggled with technical interviews, particularly coding interviews and business interviews (business is not my background). The mentors that they have to help you prepare for technical interviews are not super helpful. The job guarantee makes it so that they have a reason to help you get a job, but I honestly didn’t find them that helpful - my career coach was nice and was good emotional support but didn’t help me get referrals and didn’t help me with technical interviews. Part of the issue is that I feel like there’s only so much they can do - the data science interview process is really like the Wild West, every company does the interview process differently and it’s tough to prepare. It felt like every company was looking for something different and it was impossible to be prepared for everything because there is just so much to know. About four months into my job search process the pandemic hit, and Springboard made a couple of major improvements to the job search program. The most important improvement they made is they created a Placements team that spend their time specifically looking for referrals and “ins” at companies for you. This was extremely helpful for me, and though the job I accepted was one that I found on my own and got through networking on my own, I got a few good referrals from this team. The second major improvement that they made was getting new mentors to help you with technical interviews. I got a job soon after I started speaking with my mentor, but I felt like he was very good and better than the mentor I had worked with in the past. Overall, a mixed experience with Springboard. I appreciate that they have the job guarantee program because they do try to help you, but I wish there had been more help sooner and not just because of the pandemic.Read Less"
"Positives:+	MentorshipBy far the biggest strength of Springboard, so big that others have copied it. My mentor was just the person I had craved for a long time in my educational career: smart, good people skills, and accountable. I learned as much from... Read More him as I did in my Master’s program. The 30 minutes a week were invaluable and gave me insights I would not have found on my own.+	CurriculumFor the most part, the curriculum is very good. It’s a combination of online resources Springboard doesn’t create themselves, but if I had to learn data science all over again, I would rather learn from these resources than random Google searches. Save the Google searches for the projects, where most of the learning comes from anyway. The curriculum is also more up-to-date than an in-person program. The projects stretched me to my limits, and I came out a much better data scientist because of it. +	Course SupportThere has been an increase in course support over my time at Springboard. There is an option to have an additional mentorship meeting with a different mentor just to work on non-Capstone projects. Springboard also hosts an annual conference at their headquarters that is worth attending if you are a student. My student adviser provided great support along the way when I needed it.Negatives:-	Job SupportSpringboard is by no means a silver bullet to a dream data science job, but it’s close. You have to put in the work to landing a job to get that job afterwards. I found there were times where the career coaches were booked months in advance, but they seemed to have hired new staff. I have no doubt if you complete the course in six months that you would be ready for a DS role, but it’s an intense six months.- Completion TimeI took much longer than expected and was given extensions to finish. This was more a human error than a Springboard error, and if I felt mentally the way I do now compared to when I started Springboard, I could have easily finished in the allotted time. Just be careful with grandiose capstone projects.- FeedbackOutside of my mentor, I found feedback tough to get when handing in coursework. Overall: Great experience, would do again. The positives are fixable and far outweigh the negatives and I found it paid for itself in salary raises, even with the extensions. This is the direction education is going, and I look forward to watching what Springboard does next.Read Less"

"Overall, I had a very nice experience with SpringBoard. The most useful resources to me are my career coach and mentor. My career coach is extremely supportive, and helped me throughout my interview process, and always gave me very prompt replies. Big... Read More thanks!My (2nd) mentor is very patient, knowledgable and supportive. Always thinking from my perspective, and sharing all he knows about a problem. SpringBoard is also very supportive when I had to switch mentor two months into my program. I think it is worth the effort to find someone that is suitable for your background and situation. Don't settle down with someone you don't feel comfortable.SpringBoard administation and student advisor team are also very responsive everytime I need help. One thing that may require improvement is the course material, which appears to be a big collection of online videos and articles. So after going through, I would not treat it as a structured course like from school, but rather a big libary with most things about data science up to now. The good thing is that I provides me a complete picture of what are the things available and need to know. But some people may feel overwhelmed if they try to completely read everything, and lose focus. My advice is that feel free to skip and bookmark some of them (most of them are free online materials that you can always access), but just be aware that they exist and come back when you really need them.Read Less"
"This program has many great resources to help you advance your skills as well as a curriculum that keeps you focused and scheduled in completing your work. There is a community of people looking to help you including career coaches, weekly mentor calls,... Read More which I used to discuss the projects I was working on as well as specific questions about coding. And an online forum of students asking questions pertaining to the same types of projects you are working on. The main focus of the course is completing two main capstone projects which are geared towards building your portfolio and are exemplary of work one may do in a data science career. While there are many smaller mini projects included in the course that are also good practice to improving python and sql skills, there could be created content designed for learning the code and applications needed in these types of assignments. A significant portion of the curriculum was just courses on DataCamp and video lectures, while informative, are not particularly useful in grasping the concepts needed. For an expensive course, I was expecting more specialized resources focused on learning the skills needed, rather than just projects that force you to know the material and go out and use it, which is difficult at first and slowed my progress throughout the beginning of the course. I viewed this as being both a good and bad thing, because although I began working on these projects without all the necessary knowledge and skills, it forced me to pick them up as I went along.Read Less"

"Springboard has a practical, relevant, and project-based curriculum that I absolutely loved. I liked that the materials I learned were from industry experts, rather than purely theoretical. I also had excellent support from my mentor, Angelo, throughout... Read More the coursework and with my project. I am coming from a rather different industry, and he helped me learn a bunch of new tools that would be more relevant to UX.For an area of improvement, I'd like to see more of an outflow process for graduates when it comes to the job search. For example, if certain graduates/mentors live in a certain area, I'd like to find a way to connect with them through Springboard, so that I could pursue the possibility of following up in person.Other than that, I would highly recommend this program to any friends who are looking to get involved in UX, or to brush up on the fundamentals on their own time.Read Less"
"Springboard's Data Science Intensive is a great blend of self paced study, practical coursework, and mentor led training. As part of my mid-career self improvement, I had begun looking at post graduate data science programs at nearby universities. During... Read More my research I came across Springboard which was offering a course of training that covered all the same topics as the university programs with better cost and schedule, and complete with access to a data science mentor currently working in the industry.Having completed the program in early 2017, I feel I came out with a solid technical foundation in data science techniques and tools. On top of that, the practical advice from my awesome mentors was highly valuable with insights into day to day responsibilities and expectations. And, while the sense of community may not have been directly integrated into the course, Springboard does provide the infrastructure of slack channels and office hours for support and communication among students.Read Less"

"My prime goal with this course was to advance and formally train myself in data science fundamentals, apply them immediately at my work and lay a solid foundation in data science to continue on the path to become a data scientist. The course was able... Read More to deliver just that. One of the best thing about the course is the ability to connect 1:1 to an industry expert in field. This luxury is never possible with any other online course. The ability to discuss coursework, capstone, and even general data science questions, was immensely useful to me. I found Springboard's coursework to be the most well-filtered and appropriately consolidated, keep the best resources available on the internet in the syllabus. G+ community is also very resourceful, with students and mentors always eager to help. Kane, Rachel and my mentor Matt were plain awesome.
